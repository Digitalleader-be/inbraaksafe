Some people have an ability to write placeholder text... It's an art you're basically born with. You either have it or you don't. Lorem Ipsum better hope that there are no "tapes" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!
		You know, it really doesn’t matter what you write as long as you’ve got a young, and beautiful, piece of text. You know, it really doesn’t matter what you write as long as you’ve got a young, and beautiful, piece of text. Look at these words. Are they small words? And he referred to my words - if they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there's no problem, I guarantee.
		I have a 10 year old son. He has words. He is so good with these words it's unbelievable. Be careful, or I will spill the beans on your placeholder text. I'm speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and I've said a lot of things. Look at that text! Would anyone use that? Can you imagine that, the text of your next webpage?!
		An ‘extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me that Barack Obama’s placeholder text is a fraud. Lorem Ipsum better hope that there are no "tapes" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press! I know words. I have the best words.
		We are going to make placeholder text great again. Greater than ever before. An ‘extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me that Barack Obama’s placeholder text is a fraud. Does everybody know that pig named Lorem Ipsum? She's a disgusting pig, right?</p>
